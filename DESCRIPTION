Description: The package is designed to analyse the primary endpoint of
    the lung trial NARLAL2 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02354274).
    All software is developed without access to the clinical data and
    before the end of recruitment of the data. Included in this package is
    a function able to generate demo data. These demo data were imported
    into an empty copy of the clinical database. The demo data was then
    exported from the trial database and included as part of the current
    package. The package includes a demo script. To find the location of the
    demo script, use the command: 
    system.file(package='Narlal2','scripts/DemoForTheNarlalPackage.R')
    after import of the library.
